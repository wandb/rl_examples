# Training LLMs using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains examples that show how to train LLMs with reinforcement learning and how to build agents. In these examples, you will learn to:

- Trace rollouts with [Weave](https://docs.wandb.ai/weave), view prompts, outputs, rewards, etc. in one place
- Use `Weave` with popular frameworks like `TRL`, `verl`, `OpenPipe`, and `verifiers`
- Use the `OpenPipe` serverless API to train models calls without hosting your own stack
- Build and test agents with open models using RL, with repeatable logs and evals
